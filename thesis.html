    <li><b>Abstract</b>

<p>
The deployment of knowledge representation formalisms to the Web has
created the need for hybrid formalisms that combine heterogeneous
knowledge bases (KBs). There are many formalisms proposed by the knowledge
representation community for modeling knowledge bases, among
which two families are of great importance, in particular in the context of
semantic Web. One is the family of Description Logics (DLs) based ontologies,
and the other is rule-based logic programming.
</p>

<p>
The challenge of combining ontologies and rules has been
drawing a lot of attentions in recent years. Among several proposed
approaches, loose coupling of rules and ontologies aims at combining
respective knowledge bases by means of a clean interfacing semantics,
in which roughly speaking inferences are mutually exchanged such that
the one KB takes the imported information into account, and exports in
turn conclusions to the other KB. This approach is fostered by
non-monotonic description logic (dl-) programs, where this exchange is
handled by a generalization of the answer set semantics of
non-monotonic logic programs.
</p>

<p>
Because of the loose coupling nature of dl-Programs, one can build
engines for dl-Programs on top of legacy reasoners. For instance, the
dlvhex system with dl-plugin, which is a state-of-the-art system for
dl-Programs, is built on top of the ASP reasoner DLV and the DL
reasoner RacerPro. Although this architecture is very elegant, the
performance of this implementation is suboptimal. We observe that the
overhead of calling external reasoners in the classical approach can
be the bottleneck of the performance.
</p>

<p>
The aim of this thesis is to improve the reasoning efficiency over
hybrid KBs. We propose a new strategy, called inline
evaluation, which compiles the whole hybrid KB into a new KB using
only one single formalism. Hence we can use a single reasoner to do
the reasoning tasks, and improve the efficiency of hybrid reasoning.
In case of DL-Programs, we design an abstract framework rewriting
dl-Programs to Datalog programs with negation, by compiling all
components carefully and combining them together into a single program.
The reduction is sound and complete when the DL ontologies are
"Datalog-rewritable". We show that many DLs are Datalog-rewritable
by introducing concrete rewriting algorithms. Furthermore, we show
that inline evaluation can be used in hybrid KBs of other formalisms.
</p>

<p>
To confirm the hypothesis that the inline evaluation is superior to
the classical approach of ``ASP + external DL reasoner'', we implement
the inline evaluation method in the novel DReW system for
dl-Programs. We conduct an extensive evaluation on several benchmark
suites and show that DReW outperforms the classical approach in general,
especially for
dl-Programs of complex structure or with large instances.
